# 👋 Hi, I'm Vladyslav Savkiv (s1zyy)

Backend-focused developer building full-stack applications using Java (Spring Boot) and native iOS (Swift).

I design REST APIs, implement authentication (JWT), and build client-server systems from scratch.

---

## 🚀 Featured Project: Post App (Full-Stack)

A full-stack application where users can register, authenticate, and create/manage posts.

The project demonstrates a complete client-server architecture with a custom backend and a native iOS client.

---

### 🔧 Backend (Java, Spring Boot)

- Built RESTful API for user authentication and post management
- Implemented JWT-based authentication & authorization
- Integrated PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Designed clean and structured backend architecture

---

### 📱 iOS Client (Swift)

- Native iOS app using UIKit (programmatic UI)
- Integrated with backend via REST API (URLSession)
- Supports full CRUD operations for posts
- Uses Core Data for local persistence

---

### 🧠 Architecture

iOS App → Spring Boot REST API → PostgreSQL
